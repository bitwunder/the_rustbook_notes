# Enums and Pattern Matching
In this chapter we’ll look at enumerations,

* Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants

## In this chapter:
1. First, we’ll [define](./defining_enums.md) and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with data. 
2. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful `enum`, called `Option`, which expresses that a value can be either something or nothing.
3. Then we’ll look at how pattern matching in the [match expression](./match_control_flow.md) makes it easy to run different code for different values of an enum. 
4. Finally, we’ll cover how the [if let construct](./if_let_construct.md) is another convenient and concise idiom available to handle enums in your code.
