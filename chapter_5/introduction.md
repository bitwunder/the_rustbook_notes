* A **struct**, or **structure**

  - is a custom data type
  - that lets you package together
  - and name multiple related values 
  - that make up a meaningful group. 

### In this chapter:
* compare and contrast tuples with structs
* demonstrate when structs are a better way to group data
* how to [define and instantiate structs](./1_defining_and_instanciating_structs.md)
* how to define [associated functions](./3_method_syntax.md)
