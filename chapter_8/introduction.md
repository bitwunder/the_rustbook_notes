# Common Collections

* Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called **`collections`**
* collections can contain multiple values
* the data these collections point to is **stored on the heap**
* collections that are used very often in Rust:
  - A **`vector`** allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
  - A string is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the String type previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.
  - A hash map allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a map.
